# react-native-canvas
An attempt to bring an OpenGL backed  &lt;canvas> to ReactNative. Largely ported from ImpactJS's Ejecta.



## About

This is a project that, like many of my sideprojects has sat unworked on for many months.

My orginal intention was to very lightly wrap ChartJS and enable an easy way to embed cross platform charts in React-Native applicatsions. This seemed to work quite well ( though there is still a rather long todo list to get the rest of the chart types working nicely ).
